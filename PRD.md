# Product Requirements Document: Secure TEE Code Execution Platform

## Overview

A secure code execution platform that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to safely run arbitrary code snippets. The system consists of two main components:

1. Docker Deployment Service
2. Secure Code Execution Service

## 1. Docker Deployment Service

### Purpose

Provide a secure and automated way to deploy Docker containers in TEE environments.

### Core Features

- Secure environment variable handling with encryption
- TEE-compatible Docker deployment
- Support for custom Docker compose configurations
- Automated key management and encryption
- Error handling and deployment validation

### Technical Requirements

- Support for x25519 key exchange
- AES-GCM encryption for environment variables
- HTTP client for TEE cloud API interaction
- Docker compose manifest generation
- Volume management for persistent storage

## 2. Secure Code Execution Service

### Purpose

Enable secure, concurrent execution of code snippets in isolated environments within a TEE container.

### Supported Languages (Phase 1)

1. Python
2. JavaScript/Node.js
3. TypeScript
4. Java
5. Go
6. C++
7. PHP
8. Swift

### Core Features

#### Execution Pipeline

- Language-specific runtime environments with version control
- Dependency management and isolation
- Resource monitoring and limits enforcement
- Execution timeout handling
- Process statistics collection (memory usage, execution time)
- Concurrent execution support

#### Process Isolation

- Sandboxed execution per request
- Memory and process monitoring
- Resource cleanup after execution
- File system isolation per execution

#### Performance Monitoring

- Real-time memory usage tracking
- Peak memory monitoring
- Execution time measurement
- Process statistics collection

### Technical Architecture

#### Components

1. Code Executor

   - Manages execution lifecycle
   - Creates isolated sandboxes
   - Handles language-specific setup
   - Manages resource limits

2. Sandbox Environment

   - Process isolation
   - Resource monitoring
   - File system isolation
   - Memory tracking
   - Cleanup management

3. Language Executors
   - Language-specific setup
   - Dependency management
   - Compilation (if needed)
   - Runtime configuration

#### Execution Flow

1. Request Reception

   ```rust
   pub struct ExecutionRequest {
       language: Language,
       code: String,
       dependencies: Vec<Dependency>,
       timeout: Duration,
       env_vars: HashMap<String, String>,
   }
   ```

2. Execution Setup

   - Sandbox creation with unique ID
   - Environment preparation
   - Dependency installation
   - Resource allocation

3. Code Execution

   - Process spawning with isolation
   - Memory monitoring via ps command
   - Output capture (stdout/stderr)
   - Resource tracking

4. Result Collection
   ```rust
   pub struct ExecutionResult {
       status: ExecutionStatus,
       stdout: String,
       stderr: String,
       process_stats: ProcessStats,
   }
   ```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Docker deployment library implementation
2. Basic TEE integration
3. Environment variable encryption
4. Initial deployment pipeline

### Phase 2: Code Execution Service

1. Base container image creation
2. Language runtime support
3. Dependency management system
4. Code execution pipeline

### Phase 3: Security & Scaling

1. Resource limiting
2. Security hardening
3. Performance optimization
4. Multi-instance support

## Success Metrics

1. Performance

   - Average execution time
   - Memory usage efficiency
   - Concurrent execution capacity
   - Resource utilization

2. Reliability

   - Successful execution rate
   - Error handling effectiveness
   - Resource cleanup success rate
   - System stability

3. Security
   - Process isolation effectiveness
   - Resource limit enforcement
   - Sandbox integrity
   - Clean state between executions

## Technical Architecture

1. Rust-based core libraries
2. Blueprint job integration
3. TEE-compatible container system
4. Secure key management
5. Event-driven architecture

## Limitations & Constraints

1. Execution Limits

   - Maximum execution time: 5 minutes
   - Maximum memory: 512MB per execution
   - Maximum disk space: 100MB per sandbox
   - Maximum processes: 10 per sandbox
   - Maximum file size: 10MB

2. Concurrency Limits

   - Based on host resource availability
   - Configurable maximum concurrent executions
   - Resource-based scheduling

3. Security Boundaries
   - No network access by default
   - Read-only file system except for designated directories
   - Process isolation using namespaces
   - Resource monitoring and limits
