# Product Requirements Document: Secure TEE Code Execution Platform

## Overview

A secure code execution platform that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to safely run arbitrary code snippets. The system consists of two main components:

1. Docker Deployment Service
2. Secure Code Execution Service

## 1. Docker Deployment Service

### Purpose

Provide a secure and automated way to deploy Docker containers in TEE environments.

### Core Features

- Secure environment variable handling with encryption
- TEE-compatible Docker deployment
- Support for custom Docker compose configurations
- Automated key management and encryption
- Error handling and deployment validation

### Technical Requirements

- Support for x25519 key exchange
- AES-GCM encryption for environment variables
- HTTP client for TEE cloud API interaction
- Docker compose manifest generation
- Volume management for persistent storage

## 2. Secure Code Execution Service

### Purpose

Enable developers to execute code snippets securely in isolated TEE environments.

### Supported Languages (Phase 1)

1. Python
2. JavaScript/Node.js
3. Rust
4. Go
5. Java
6. C++
7. Ruby
8. PHP
9. Swift
10. TypeScript

### Core Features

- Language-specific runtime environments
- Dependency management
- Resource usage limits
- Execution timeout handling
- Secure result retrieval
- Input validation and sanitization

### Security Features

- Sandboxed execution environment
- Memory usage limits
- Network access controls
- Filesystem isolation
- Resource quotas

### API Interface

- Job submission endpoint
- Status checking
- Result retrieval
- Error handling

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Docker deployment library implementation
2. Basic TEE integration
3. Environment variable encryption
4. Initial deployment pipeline

### Phase 2: Code Execution Service

1. Base container image creation
2. Language runtime support
3. Dependency management system
4. Code execution pipeline

### Phase 3: Security & Scaling

1. Resource limiting
2. Security hardening
3. Performance optimization
4. Multi-instance support

## Success Metrics

1. Deployment success rate
2. Code execution latency
3. Resource utilization
4. Security incident rate
5. User satisfaction metrics

## Technical Architecture

1. Rust-based core libraries
2. Blueprint job integration
3. TEE-compatible container system
4. Secure key management
5. Event-driven architecture

## Limitations & Constraints

1. Maximum execution time: 5 minutes
2. Maximum memory usage: 2GB per instance
3. Maximum storage: 1GB per instance
4. Network access: Restricted
5. File system access: Read-only except for designated directories
